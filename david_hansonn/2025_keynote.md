# Merchants of complexity

Things have regressed in terms of complication, now teams of 50, do slower, than what small teams did in 1999.

Merchnts of complexity sell complex solutions

We want to feel smart and use CS degrees not to just be CRUD monkeys

Reducing that complexity allows us to solve problems end to end.

ROR tries to solve ALL problems needed to solve making web applications

Sharp tools in rails

Conquer more in Rails

Markdown - Lingua Franca of AI

`format.md` rails 8.1 similar to `format.json`

Lexxy New ActionText editor

### ActionJob Continuations
New way to structure jobs so they can be interrupted, then resume without losing progress.

## Native frontier

Have to interact with native apps to make competitive web apps
customers WANT native apps

turbo offline
single web page no JS
solve for native, solve for all web apps
v1- cache as you go
v2 cache on demand(preemptively cache certain pages)

Integrated in Hotwire Native

#### Action Push

fka ActionNotifier
mobile push notifications

## Prune

local host runs apps in rails
no reason to run ssl locally during development


### Native Ruby + Docker RBs

Docker - when you have services that need to be run in diff versions, really nice to have diff versions
=> run everything in docker
- Different rubies (Mees)
Docker DB's

### System test

Wonderful in theory, flow through FE, BE, DB
but always brittle

use ONLY as smoke path
Yanking recommendation in rails 8.1. to have controller tests.

### Local CI

10 min to run tests on small app
complexity is a bridge

Vast majority of people should be able to run entire test suite locally

"it works on cloud" is similar to "it works on my machine" i.e. not necessarily a real representation
Pin down dependencies && Version Ruby version(Mees) DB version

Signoff GH feature (someone else pulls and runs tests)

DSL for local CI run

Bootstrap budget
15 min cold new machine => production deploy

People who are really serious about software should make their own OS
